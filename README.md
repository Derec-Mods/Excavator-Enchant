Enchant for pickaxes allowing them to mine 3x3x3 areas, taking into account enchants and durability. Helps with mass resource gathering on big survival worlds!

A lot of datapacks add this idea, as well as mods, and I wanted to implement it in an optimized plugin form, with the recent release of Paper API's https://docs.papermc.io/paper/dev/lifecycle/datapacks/

**To repeat**, as of latest updates, this plugin now requires PaperMC. If you've been running a survival server, you should have switched to PaperMC/Purpur/any other fork of it ALREADY, to improve your server performance. You should NOT be running Spigot or a Vanilla server in 2026. 

## Features
- New enchant: Excavating 
- Put it on a pickaxe to mine 3x3 areas! It will apply all enchants/durability effects 

## Planned Improvements
- Different levels, so players can choose between how much of a radius they want to mine (initially 3x3, then 3x3x3)

This was created for use on my forever world, called "derex smp", and now I am sharing it with the world. The server is named after the COVID-era derex smp [sic], a Minecraft survival multiplayer server that ran from summer 2020 to early 2022, filled with lore, drama, and memories.
